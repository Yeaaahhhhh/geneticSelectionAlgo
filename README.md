# geneticSelectionAlgo
The project will focus on solving an TSP problem by using genetic algorithm (GA).                     
The requirements are as follows:                         
The traveling salesman has to visit n cities and eventually return to the departure city, requiring that each city be visited only once, with the optimization goal of minimizing the sum of the distances traveled.[1]

            Since the model of the TSP problem can be applied to many areas. Such as the current 
take-out delivery worker industry, family outing schedule, Amazon, Canada Post's mailman 
industry and so on. All of these areas need to get the goods or travelers to the appropriate 
destination in the shortest possible time. The shorter the total distance traveled, the shorter the 
time spent if other factors are not taken into accoun
